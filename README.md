# Deep Learning Image Classifier App

## Overview
This repo contains an [App Designer](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/appdesigner.html) app for training an image classification deep neural networks in MATLAB. Using this app, you can:

- 🖼️ Import, visualize, and augment data
- ⚡ Quickly transfer learn with the SqueezeNet pretrained network
- 🛠️ Modify pretrained networks for transfer learning with Deep Network Designer
- 📥 Import networks from the workspace
- 🔍 Explain predictions with explainability techniques like Grad-CAM and LIME
- 🧾 Generate MATLAB code for training an image classifier

 You can also edit and customize the app code for your own task.

## Requirements
 - [MATLAB &reg; R2025a](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) or later
 - [Deep Learning Toolbox&trade;](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)
 - (Optional) [Parallel Computing Toolbox&trade;](https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) to train models on GPU
 - (Optional) [Image Processing Toolbox&trade;](https://www.mathworks.com/products/image-processing.html) to use the `imageLIME` interpretability function

## Using the App
Import data and apply standard augmentations.
